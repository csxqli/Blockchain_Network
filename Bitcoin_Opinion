Many, many businesses both here and abroad will be forced to support both chains should a HF occur, and a subset of those (possibly a large subset) may choose to support the segwit2x fork and turn it into a 'retail' coin.
 
 
A) The segwit2x fork is not close to being production ready and would likely take more than a year to be close
B) Bitcoin is not meant, nor was it ever meant to be a 'retail' / KYC / merchant-adopted coin. You can clearly see it in the code and as a user, as well as in the sentiment expressed by the people that created it (devs). Trying to turn it into that would be catastrophic. It is meant to be gold and a store of wealth - not a merchant coin.
C) The Miners are not stepping down, each day it appears more and more likely a fork will occur. Over 90% of recent blocks mined are signaling Segwit2x. (https://coin.dance/blocks)
D) At this time a fork appears to be very likely
E) Most large companies and payment processors would have no choice but to halt all BTC transactions on July 31 unless something changes
F) You can watch devs discussing solutions daily here https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-July/date.html#start as well as on twitter/slack - it doesn't look good as far as HF goes.
 
Conclusion: I do not think BTC is going to die for certain - a HF is actually probably good in the long run - but I do think there will probably be mass-confusion/chaos for a while
